# Decentralized Agricultural Insurance

A blockchain-based parametric insurance platform that provides transparent, efficient, and affordable crop protection for farmers worldwide through automated weather monitoring and streamlined claims processing.

## Overview

The Decentralized Agricultural Insurance platform revolutionizes crop insurance by leveraging blockchain technology to create transparent, efficient, and accessible coverage for farmers of all sizes. By using smart contracts and verified weather data, the system automatically triggers claim payouts when predefined conditions are met, eliminating lengthy manual assessments and reducing fraud. This approach democratizes access to agricultural risk management, helping farmers build resilience against increasingly volatile climate conditions.

## Key Components

### Farm Registration Contract

The Farm Registration Contract establishes the fundamental record of insured agricultural operations on the platform.

- Captures essential farm details (location, size, crop types, growing seasons)
- Verifies land ownership or usage rights through digital attestations
- Maintains historical farm data for risk assessment and premium calculation
- Implements geospatial mapping of insured plots with precise boundaries
- Supports farm profile updates as cropping patterns change
- Records insurance policy terms, coverage limits, and premium payments
- Enables integration with existing farm management systems

### Weather Data Oracle Contract

The Weather Data Oracle Contract serves as the authoritative source of climate information for policy execution.

- Aggregates weather data from multiple trusted sources (satellites, weather stations, IoT sensors)
- Implements consensus mechanisms to validate data accuracy
- Records timestamped weather parameters (rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind)
- Provides localized weather information for specific farm locations
- Maintains historical weather data for trend analysis and risk modeling
- Detects extreme weather events that may trigger insurance payouts
- Ensures data integrity through cryptographic verification

### Crop Loss Verification Contract

The Crop Loss Verification Contract validates and quantifies agricultural damage from covered perils.

- Correlates weather events with potential crop damage scenarios
- Processes satellite imagery to assess crop health and damage extent
- Implements automated loss assessment algorithms based on vegetation indices
- Supports supplementary on-ground verification when necessary
- Detects anomalies that might indicate fraudulent claims
- Provides transparent documentation of loss verification process
- Maintains historical loss data for future risk assessment

### Claim Processing Contract

The Claim Processing Contract manages the assessment, approval, and payment of insurance claims.

- Automates claim initiation based on weather trigger events
- Calculates payout amounts based on policy terms and verified losses
- Executes immediate payments when predefined conditions are met
- Manages more complex claims requiring additional verification
- Maintains comprehensive claim history for all policies
- Implements dispute resolution mechanisms for contested claims
- Provides real-time claim status updates to policyholders

## Getting Started

### For Farmers

1. Register your farm on the platform:
   ```
   npm run register-farm
   ```
2. Provide accurate geolocation details for your fields
3. Select crops and coverage options
4. Complete premium payment through available methods
5. Monitor weather conditions and policy status through the dashboard

### For Insurance Providers

1. Register as an underwriter:
   ```
   npm run register-provider
   ```
2. Define coverage parameters and premium models
3. Allocate capital to risk pools
4. Monitor portfolio performance and risk exposure
5. Receive automated reports on claims and payments
